                    <p>Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, led India's fight for independence through nonviolence and civil disobedience. His Salt March in 1930 protested the British salt tax. He championed equality, uniting religious groups in the Khilafat Movement. Gandhi's Swadeshi Movement promoted indigenous goods and boycotted British products. The Quit India Movement in 1942 intensified pressure on British rule. His principles of truth and nonviolence influenced global civil rights movements. He negotiated with British authorities, shaping India's future. Gandhi's legacy promotes love and compassion for social change. His efforts led to India's independence in 1947. Unfortunately, he was assassinated in 1948 by a person with extreme beliefs. His influence remains an inspiration for justice and peaceful resistance worldwide.</p>

                    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, a key freedom fighter, left an indelible mark on India's independence struggle. His assertive stance set him apart within the Indian National Congress. Leading the Forward Bloc, he advocated for a more forceful approach. Bose's mysterious disappearance in 1945 added intrigue to his story. His contributions include leading the Indian National Army (INA), which fought alongside Japanese forces to liberate India. Through Azad Hind Radio, his stirring speeches rallied Indians against colonial rule. His audacious escape from British house arrest in 1941 underscored his determination. Seeking Axis support during WWII, Bose established connections with leaders like Hitler. In 1943, he formed a Provisional Government of Free India in Singapore. The INA trials and public support influenced India's road to independence. His call, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," continues to inspire. Subhas Chandra Bose's dedication and vision for a strong, free India endure as a source of inspiration.</p>

                        His arrest and subsequent trial became a platform to articulate his vision for a free India, marked by his iconic slogan "Inquilab Zindabad."
                        Executed in 1931 for his role in the killing of a British police officer, Singh's martyrdom ignited national fervor and intensified the fight for freedom.
